# dust-devil
A package of logic and components that are common to TEAMNADO's console.redhat.com applications.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this package is to support our team's common use cases.
However, anyone is free to use this if it provides value.

## Naming
A Dust Devil is a tornado in the desert.
This package was created to make TEAMNADO more [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
